# MURDOC - Affordable Braille Printing for the Visually Impaired

## Project Overview

MURDOC is an innovative project aimed at addressing the limited access to Braille materials for visually impaired individuals in Mexico. Our goal is to develop an affordable Braille printer capable of producing high-quality Braille text at a cost significantly lower than current options. This device is designed to be accessible, functional, and aligned with the standards set by the National Organization of the Blind in Spain (ONCE), ultimately fostering greater inclusion and independence for the visually impaired community.

## Key Achievements

- **Prototype Development:** We successfully created a working prototype of the Braille printer at a cost lower than anticipated. The device demonstrates reliable electronic and software functionality, with a printing mechanism that, while requiring further refinement, has proven the viability of our design approach.
  
- **Collaborative Research:** Extensive collaboration with educational institutions and professionals in the field provided us with critical insights and guidance, ensuring that the device meets user needs and adheres to established standards.

- **Technological Innovation:** The project utilized advanced 3D printing techniques and computer-aided design (CAD) software to develop the device. Integration of components such as Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, and solenoids ensured the precise control necessary for Braille printing.

## Next Steps

The next phase of the project will focus on refining the printing mechanism to eliminate irregularities and further optimize the design for cost-effectiveness. We will continue to gather feedback from users and experts to guide these improvements, ensuring that the final product fully meets the needs of the visually impaired community.
